Halloween is the biggest holiday in the West, including the United States, after Christmas. Violence erupted in seven states, including California, Florida and Texas.

At least 12 people have been killed in shootings across the United States during the festival. More than 50 people were injured.
 
The number of gun attacks in the United States has risen alarmingly during the Corona epidemic. So far this year, 800 people have lost their lives in gun violence. Last year this number was 611 and in 2019 it was 418.


Researchers say the incidence of random shootings is increasing due to the impact of the epidemic in the social and economic sectors. Attacks are most common on weekends, domestic events and boxing events held on different roads.
 
The shooting happened at a Halloween party in the state of Illinois last Sunday. At least three people were killed. 12 more people were injured. 10 to 12 shots were reported in the area. Many were injured in these incidents. Two people have been killed in a gun attack in Colorado.
 
Meanwhile, another man was shot dead by gunmen at a Halloween party in Texas. Also, another died in a shooting at a City Council member's home in Gilro, California.

U.S. officials say there has been widespread violence in seven states, including California, Florida and Texas, during Halloween this week.
